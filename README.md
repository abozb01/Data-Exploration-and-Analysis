# Data-Exploration-and-Analysis
This program focuses on in-depth data exploration and analysis. It starts by loading a dataset and performing basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) tasks. It checks for missing values, provides advanced statistical summaries, and uses data visualization techniques to understand the distribution of numerical features. Additionally, it employs box plots to visualize the relationship between categorical features and the target variable.
